I didnt hear what you were saying.
I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions never maybe
And Im not kind if you betray me.
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it babe.

If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now Im taking love
And its not my fault
Cause you both deserve
What is coming now
So dont say a word
